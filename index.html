    <!-- style block will hold style declarations for CSS, so we can make an internal style sheet. Style tag isn't visible on pages, so ok to do stuff here. Style tag can be anywhere but typical to put here. -->

    <!-- div is a selector
      the Declaration includes: border (which is a property) and 1px... (which is a value). End with ; for end of style

      Its nice to alphabatize properties, so with sublime can highlight and hit F5 to alphabatize automatically

      Now with the style added below, it will be added to each div tag automatically.

      div a selector only applies green to the a's inside div tags due to the order. This makes the first links red still, while the last links green.

      Below is how to apply somethings to each tag in a page. What is better is to use classes and id's which are below. Below this comment is how to apply style to each tag in the page, which will not be used anymore

      a {
        color: red;
      }
      div {
        border: 1px solid black;
      }
      div a{
        color: green;
      }

      id selector targests only one element per page, while class selector targets multiple elements.

      To add id put # in front of name
      To add class you add a . in front of the name.

      Can target tags inside tags that have class selector tags (or ids) on them such as the green color example below. The code below turns the a tags green if they are in an element with class bio-box-->

    <style>
      /* This is how to comment and good styling below: */
      /* GLOBAL STYLES */
      a {
        color: red;
      }
      /*Both below reset the default margin and padding of the elements below */
      html, body {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
      }
      h1 {
        font-size: 7vw;
        margin-top: 0;
      }

      /*font sizes should be relative size, not pixel defined due to different displays. Relative sizes good, pixel sizes good in certain applications like ad sizing, margins, images. Pixel sizes good for borders.*/
      /*em's are useful for text sizing. The default text size is 16px and 1em = 16px. Fractions of ems represent pixels, like 0.5em = 8px. Automatically change value based on the font size that is inhereted from parent.
      vh (viewport height) abd vw allow size elements on the page based on actual size of the browser window or mobile screen (mobile friendly). Each vw or vh is 1% of the corresponding screen dimension (3vh is 3% of screen height). Neither effected by parent elements). Bad thing about vh and vw is that stuff will look bad for desktop or mobile, use media query to fix.
      14-18px height for text size is good.
      62.5% trick: Set font-size on body to 62.5%, makes 1em equal 10px. Makes fractions better. Dont use this trick tho.
      Recommendations: Use relative units (em) for text, dont use 62.5% trick, pick random numbers that set the font size close to what youre after.*/

      /* HERO STYLES */

        /* Percentage sizing useful and based on the parent container that an element is in (not by browser/page). Width can be assumed, but height must be set on parent element and cant be assumed.
        Changes are cumulative, so if parent is 0.5em and child is 0.5em, then that child is actually 0.25em (.5*.5)
        rem can be used for font sizing where its the root em, which gets its original pixel value from the html tag (16px). 1rem will always equal this value, no matter if parent changes it.*/
